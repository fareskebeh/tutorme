        <p>
          Welcome to <strong>TutorMe</strong>, where learning meets opportunity.
          We’re on a mission to make personalized education accessible,
          empowering, and effective for every learner — no matter where they are
          in the world.

        <h2>🎯 Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At TutorMe, we believe that education is not one-size-fits-all. Every
          student learns differently, and every tutor teaches uniquely. Our
          mission is to bridge that gap by connecting students with the right
          tutors who can unlock their potential.
        </p>
